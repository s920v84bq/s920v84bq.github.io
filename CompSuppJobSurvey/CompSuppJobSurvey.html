<br>
On 11/11/13-11/12/13 indeed.com was searched for the keywords "computer support" or "pc support" or "desktop support" or "help desk" in <br>
Philadelphia, PA.  100 of the first advertisement results were used, some others were filtered out for irrelevance.  Mainly the requirements<br>
section of the advertisements was used and others were ignored at times.  Common keywords/concepts were observed and <br>
manually counted in the advertisements.<br>
Note: if associates degree was a minimum requirement listed a batchlors degree mention was not counted because the minimum<br>
degree was looked for.

<br>
This is an informal and non-scientific survey, some known inaccuracies exist such as underrepresentation of rarer categories, <br>
overlapping categories with data missing from one but not another category, and others.  The author still considers this survey to be a <br>
useful comparison in the general sense and worth looking over.  No warrenty of any kind is provided for the data's use, interpretations are <br>
made at each users' own risk.
